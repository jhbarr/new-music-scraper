# Descritption
I always find myself listening to the same songs on repeat. After a while, even my favorite songs start to sound a little bit boring. This is a web scraper that goes through and saves all of the recent songs posted to Pitchfork's new music list, so that you don't have to tediously search for new music. 

# Installation and use
- In order to run the program, you must first downlod the Scrapy library. You can do that using the following command line on mac:
    pip install scrapy

- Once you have downloaded Scrapy, you can run the following command line input:
    scrapy crawl pitchforkSpider

- A file called newMusic.json should then be created and added to the repository

# Credits
All of the data that is being scraped in this program comes from https://pitchfork.com/best/
